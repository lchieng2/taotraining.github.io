        <h1> How it works: </h1>
        <div id = "introduction">
            <p> Our goal is to give younger players a system to stay active and improve their basketball
                skills through one-hour <a class = "bold">live virtual</a> training sessions over Zoom. We understand that it 
                can be difficult to improve as a player without in-person coaching and the summer camps,
                but despite the circumstances, we truly believe all a player needs to improve is a ball,
                a little bit of guidance, and the right mentality. </p> 
            <p>We plan to run two group sessions per day (one morning and one afternoon), Monday through 
                Thursday, on a weekly basis. Morning and afternoon sessions on the same day will essentially 
                be the same.</p>
            <p> As an additional bonus, we will be hosting a free Q&A every Friday with a former Stevenson 
                basketball player. This is a fun way to learn more about how basketball has made an impact on 
                a player's life, both on and off the court. Players and parents are welcome to attend!</p>
