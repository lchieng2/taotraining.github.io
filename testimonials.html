                camps makes TAO the perfect fit for your child to prepare for the next level.</a> The coaches at TAO have a genuine passion for the game of basketball, for the alma mater, and to 
                improve the players in the community. <a class = "italics green">TAO is a great way to enhance the learning process as a Patriot basketball player and I certainly regard Tao Training as an extension of 
                the Junior Patriots."</a>

                run the Stevenson basketball camps and have a vast knowledge of what it takes to get better at hoops. They have played and coached with passion, integrity, and skill."</a>

                <a> "I cannot think of a better idea and better people to help bridge the gap between the world we once knew, and the world we now live in. Learning basketball is a whole 
                lot more than throwing a ball through a hoop.  It is about learning resilience; industriousness; trust; and teamwork. Sounds perfect for right now. <a class = "green italics">If I was looking for someone to 
                help me teach these values, along with having a good time playing basketball, I would want these fine young examples to help.</a> Wish TAO was around when I was a kid. Am I too young 
                to join?"</a>
