        <h1> Why... </h1>
        <p> Normally during summertime, we would all help run the Stevenson High School Feeder Basketball Camp for kids between the grades of 3rd-8th. 
            Despite the current circumstances, we are teaming up once again to pass on what we have learned through basketball.</p>

                    <a class = "captionTitle"> Our experiences... </a> <br> <br> For the past three years, we have worked alongside the Stevenson High School Basketball Coaches to run and manage the Summer
                     Basketball Camps. Through our experiences, we have learned what drills are most engaging and practical. We plan to utilize as many of 
                     these drills to prepare young players for their future seasons.

                    <a class = "captionTitle"> What we have accomplished... </a> <br> <br> As teammates the past 3 years, we have won 2 Regional Titles and a Sectional Title, while finishing with a combined record of 73-20.
                    Over this time, the six of us have grown to become close friends. Even though half of us spent our last year at college away from the team, 
                    we have still kept in touch and connected to the game.
